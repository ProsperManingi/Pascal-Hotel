## Data Source
The primary datasets include: "dim_date.csv", "dim_hotels.csv", "dim_rooms.csv", "fact_booking_clean" and "facts_aggregated_bookings_clean.csv" these contain the the key information of the hotel operations.

## Tools Used
- MS SQL Server
- MS Power BI

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
In the intial data preparation phase, we peformed the following tasks:

- Created a database on SQL server for Mitron Bank.
- Then added tables to the database using the csv files.
- Joined the tables to form 1 with comprehensive report.
- Then transformed the data to Power BI for visualisation.

## Explanatory Data Analysis
EDA involved looking at the sample dataset provided by the bank as they seek to launch the new credit card and answer key questions such as:
1. What platform is likely to be used by customers for bookings?
2. Which hotel bring in the most revenue?
3. Which class of rooms are most prefered.
4. Which days and months did the hotels generate most revenue?
5. How many of the bookings where actually successful?

## Data Analysis
